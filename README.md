## Instructions

### :thought_balloon: General Tips

Several tools make use of mottie's [tablesorter](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/#Introduction) plugin, which includes useful additional features such as multi-column sorting with <kbd>Shift</kbd> or special characters for [filtering](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-filter.html).

We recommend installing [Jack's extension](https://github.com/DevJackSmith/mh-helper-extension#mousehunt-helper-extension) if you have not already. It records valuable information from **active hunts** only. Most of the data supporting recent updates has been sourced from Jack's publicly accessible [database backups](https://keybase.pub/devjacksmith/mh_backups/).

_Disclaimer:_ Newer tools like 'Crafting Wizard' and 'Trap Setup Powers' may be incompatible with outdated or feature-constrained browsers such as Internet Explorer, Opera Mini, Samsung Internet, and Blackberry Browser. Older tools may also become incompatible with these browsers at any point.

### :bookmark: Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are pieces of JavaScript code that are saved as a bookmark in the user's browser, enabling them to interact with webpages on the fly. We provide 9 different bookmarklets: Catch Rate Estimator, Map Solver, Best Setup: Load Items, Best Setup: Fields, Markeplace Analyzer, Silver Crown Solver, Crafting Wizard, Powers: Worksheet and the all-in-one Auto-Loader. They are each available on their corresponding tool's page.

Using the Auto-Loader is recommended because it automatically grabs the latest version of each bookmarklet without having to manually update.

You **must** be on the official [mousehuntgame.com](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/) website for these bookmarklets to work. Same-origin policy blocks access to DOM elements and requests to server endpoints while playing in Facebook's `<iframe>`.

_Note:_ The process of using a bookmarklet in mobile browsers can vary. For example, in Chrome for Android, you must type the first few characters of the bookmarklet's name in the address bar and click it from there for the code to take effect.

|    Bookmarklet    | Functionality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### &sect; Browser Installation Tips

Drag the blue bookmarklet link to your browser's bookmarks bar. If that doesn't work, try the following manual instructions. These concepts apply to other browsers (including mobile), but specific steps may vary.

<br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/chrome_12-48/chrome_12-48_32x32.png" alt="Chrome" id="chrome"><br>
_Google Chrome_

1. Bookmark an arbitrary page and give it a memorable name like 'CRE' or 'Auto-Loader'
1. Copy the bookmarklet code by right-clicking its link and selecting `Copy link address`
1. Right-click on your newly created bookmark and select `Edit...`
1. Paste the bookmarklet code into the `URL` field and hit `Save`

<br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/firefox_23-56/firefox_23-56_32x32.png" alt="Firefox" id="firefox"><br>
_Mozilla Firefox_

1. Right-click on the bookmarklet link, select `Bookmark This Link`, and name it accordingly

<br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/edge/edge_32x32.png" alt="Edge" id="Edge"> <img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/internet-explorer_9-11/internet-explorer_9-11_32x32.png" alt="Edge" id="edge"><br>
_Microsoft Edge / Internet Explorer_

1. Bookmark an arbitrary page and give it a memorable name like 'CRE' or 'Auto-Loader'
1. Copy the bookmarklet code by right-clicking its link and selecting `Copy link`
1. Go to 'Hub -> Favorites', right-click on your newly created bookmark and click `Edit URL`
1. Paste the bookmarklet code into the text field and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save
1. If that doesn't work, there is a third-party application called [EdgeManage](http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html) that claims to add a lot of missing features for managing Favorites - please use at your own discretion
1. Internet Explorer 11 allows you to drag bookmarklets directly to your favorites bar, or right-click and choose `Add to favorites`. However, it doesn't seem to support certain JavaScript features that enable the bookmarklets to run properly

<br><img src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/browser-logos/45.3.0/archive/safari_1-7/safari_1-7_32x32.png" alt="Safari" id="safari"><br>
_Apple Safari_

1. Bookmark an arbitrary page and give it a memorable name
1. Right-click on the bookmarklet link and select `Copy Link`
1. Right-click on the newly created bookmark, select `Edit Address`, paste into the text box, and click `Done`

### :straight_ruler: [Catch Rate Estimator](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/cre.html)

> Calculates catch rate estimates along with points, gold, minimum luck and more.

**Bookmarklet:** Run the `CRE` bookmarklet from basically any page on the MH website.

|           Descriptor           |  Per  |    Sum or Average (bottom row)    |
| :----------------------------: | :---: | :-------------------------------: |
|        Attraction Rate         | Mouse |        Sum for this setup         |
|           Catch Rate           | Mouse |      Average for this setup       |
| Catches / 100 hunts (AR \* CR) | Mouse |         Sum per 100 hunts         |
|              Gold              | Catch |         Average per hunt          |
|             Points             | Catch |         Average per hunt          |
|         Tourney Points         | Catch |         Average per hunt          |
|            Min Luck            | Mouse | Highest for this particular setup |
|              Rank              | Catch |             Per hunt              |

<br>

#### &sect; Sample Size Score

An indicator of the quality and accuracy of a specific setup's data based on its sample size and the number of mice in its attraction pool. Setups are separated by locations, sublocations, cheeses and occasionally charms (if they have attraction-altering effects i.e. Warpath Warrior Charm in Waves 1-3 of Fiery Warpath). If you have a charm selected that doesn't affect a setup's mouse population pool, its corresponding "No Charm" data is displayed, since they are equivalent.

Previously, the tool displayed a flat sample size number with a rating assigned to it, which looked like `Sample Size: 300 (bad)` or `Sample Size: 100000 (excellent)`. This format was misleading because it didn't encode important contextual information. The current scoring scheme takes into account factors such as number of mice in a particular setup, 95% confidence levels, and relative margins of error. It combines and normalizes these factors into a single number, capped at 100.

_Note:_ Certain setups may have low scores or even no sample size data attached to them. This could be because: (1) the data was extracted from HornTracker before we decided to start keeping track of sample sizes, (2) there aren't enough recorded hunts for that setup in Jack's database, (3) our population fetching scripts need to be re-run.

#### &sect; Special Catch Rate Effects

The following special effects _are included in catch rate calculations_ for both CRE and Best Setup.

* Final Catch Rate Modifiers
  * Zugzwang's Ultimate Move: 50% increased catch rate in Seasonal Garden & Zugzwang's Tower when amplifier > 0%
  * Fort Rox: 50% increased catch rate when upgrades are level 2 or 3; 100% catch rate on Nightmancer and Nightfire when upgrades are level 3
  * Anniversary weapons: Up to 10% increased catch rate
  * Ultimate Charm: 100% catch rate
  * Ultimate Anchor Charm: 100% catch rate while on a dive in Sunken City
  * Bounty Hunter: 100% catch rate with Sheriff's Badge Charm equipped
  * Zurreal the Eternal: 0% catch rate without Zurreal's Folly equipped
* Special Bonuses & Effects
  * Rook Crumble Charm: 300% power bonus on Rook mice in Zugzwang's Tower
  * Pawn Pinchers: +10920 power on corresponding Pawn, -60 power and -5 Luck on opposite Pawn
  * Obvious Ambush / Blackstone Pass: +1800 power on corresponding side, -2400 power on opposite side
  * Dragonbane Charms: +300/600/900% power bonus on Dragon-type mice
  * Taunting Charm: Only applies Rift Set bonuses on WWRift bosses
  * Super Warpath Charms: +50 power on corresponding groups
  * King Grub/Scarab: Salt level applies a logarithmic function to decrease mouse
  * Golem Guardian skins: Charge levels are set in CRE and carry over to Best Setup

### :earth_americas: [Map Solver and Mouse Finder](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/map.html)

> Calculates ideal specific locations to hunt for a given list of mice. Based on Chad's and <a href="http://olf.github.io/mhmapsolver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olaf's</a> solvers.

**Bookmarklet:** Run the `Map` bookmarklet from the "Active Map - Mice" section of the UI.

<p>Copy and paste mice from maps, or type names leaving a line break between each. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to autocomplete and <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through autocomplete suggestions. Additionally, autocomplete can be toggled on/off (requires a page refresh to take effect).</p>

"Fused" cheeses (e.g. Gouda/Brie/Swiss) will often show up in results. This indicates that attraction proportions from the underlined cheese has been extrapolated due to low sample sizes.

| Type of Attraction Rate | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raw                     | Shown for individual mice                                               |
| Total                   | Sum for a specific location, sublocation, cheese, and charm             |
| Weighted                | Same as Total AR, but with baseline cheese attraction rates factored in |

#### &sect; Cheese Filters

Cheese filters allow you to easily hide certain cheeses from the Best Locations table depending on your hunting situation. For example, frugal hunters may want to tick the `Magic Essence` checkbox to hide costly SB+ derived cheeses.

You can `Apply` filters to the first column, `Reset` filters on the table, or `Clear` all of your ticks.

| Filter Category        | Cheeses                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Magic Essence          | SB+, Moon, Maki, Maki String, Magical String, Magical Rancid Radioactive Blue                                                  |
| Common                 | Brie, Brie String, Cheddar, Gouda, Marble, Marble String, Swiss, Swiss String                                                  |
| Marketplace            | Crescent, Magical String, Maki, Maki String, Moon, Rancid Radioactive Blue, SB+                                                |
| Shoppe                 | All four Camemberts, Fishy Fromage, Grilled, Sunrise (separate niche from common?)                                             |
| Crafted                | Resonator, Vanilla Stilton, Vengeful Vanilla Stilton, White Cheddar... (many more TBD)                                         |
| Event (_not included_) | Cupcake Colby, Dumpling, Extra Sweet Cupcake Colby, Marshmallow Monterey, Nian Gao'da, Rewind Raclette, Rockforth, Runny, etc. |

### :trophy: [Best Setup](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/setup.html)

> Calculates the best trap setup to use for a particular location, sublocation, cheese and/or charm.

**Bookmarklet(s):** Run the `Setup: Load Items` bookmarklet on the Camp page and your items will be automatically loaded, ticked, and cached on the Best Setup page. Run the `Setup: Fields` bookmarklet on basically any page on the MH website and your hunting setup will be automatically loaded into the tool.

To check whether all of your items have properly loaded, you may want to open up the [JavaScript console](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/a/77337) in your browser, both on your MH Camp page and on the Best Setup page. You will then want to compare `Number of bases/weapons/charms: # detected` values from the former with `Bases/Weapons/Charms: # owned / # total` from the latter.

'Number of rows to display' is set at 50 by default, with options for 100, 500, 1000, or All rows. When running calculations with close to the maximum number of weapons and bases selected, **keep the number of rows low** if possible to avoid excessive CPU/RAM usage.

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: [Marketplace Analyzer](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/analyzer.html)

> Displays all of your marketplace transactions along with some useful aggregations.

**Bookmarklet:** Run the `Analyzer` bookmarklet, and click 'Send to Tool' once you have gathered enough transactions using 'Fetch'.

|    Type     | Description                                                      |
| :---------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction | Gold spent or received in a single trade                         |
|   Amount    | Total spent or received for an item or action (includes tariffs) |
|    Price    | Amount ÷ Quantity (includes tariffs)                             |
| Unit Price  | Gold spent on a single unit in a transaction (excludes tariffs)  |
|   Tariffs   | 10% of 'Buy' actions (`Amount - (Math.floor(Amount ÷ 1.1))`)     |

<div align="right"><a href="#book-table-of-contents">Top</a></div>

### :crown: [Crown Solver](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/crown.html)

> Calculates the best locations to achieve 10/100/500 catches of mouse breeds (Bronze and Gold coming soon).

**Bookmarklet:** Run the `Crown` bookmarklet from Hunter's Profile -> King's Crowns to automatically populate the 50 Bronze Crown mice that are closest to reaching Silver status (100 catches)

This spin-off of the Map Solver by [vsong](https://github.com/vsong) factors in the difference between 100 and the number of catches you currently have for a breed. All else being equal, a mouse with 99 catches is weighted more heavily than one with 80 catches.

| Type of Crown Progress | Description                                                                           |
| :--------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|          Raw           | Shown for individual mice, factors in attraction rate and catches remaining until 100 |
|         Total          | Sum for a specific location, sublocation, cheese, and charm                           |
|        Weighted        | Same as Total CP, but with baseline cheese attraction rates factored in               |

### :hammer: [Crafting Wizard](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/crafting.html)

> Calculates craftable quantities and missing materials for recipes based on your inventory data.

**Bookmarklet:** Run the `Crafting` bookmarklet from Inventory -> Crafting -> [Crafting Table](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/inventory.php?tab=crafting&subtab=crafting_table). The `Recipes` and `Inventory` tables should be automatically populated, with the former being sortable and filterable. Crafting materials are saved in localStorage.

### :mag: [Trap Setup Powers](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/powers.html)

> Shows the weapons, bases, and charms that match a specified power range and type. Synergizes with the 'Best Setup: Load Items' bookmarklet to use only items you own.

To understand why this tool exists, we need to take a crash course (or a peek behind the curtain if you will) on MouseHunt's game mechanics.

The best formula we have for calculating catch rate and minimum luck was [derived in 2011](https://mhanalysis.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/mousehunt-catch-rates-3-0/). As you can see, it takes into account several variables: power type effectiveness, trap power, trap luck, and mouse power. It turns out that total trap power and luck are easy to calculate, since item and effect stats are present in-game. However, neither mouse powers nor exact type effectiveness values are as easily obtained.

Given the unknowns, you may wonder how folks have determined these hidden mouse power numbers with such precision in the past. Kristian G wrote an [essential guide](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/forum/showthread.php?106764-how-do-people-find-mouse-power-values&p=1166955&viewfull=1#post1166955) on this trial and error process a few years back - please read it. The TL;DR gist is that we equip different weapons, bases, and charms to attain a specific total trap power. Then, we look at the description page of the mouse we're targeting and note its 'Difficulty' rating. Depending on what that label says and what boundary is targeted (i.e. Challenging/Difficult, Easy/Moderate), we can deduce upper/lower bounds for the mouse's power. Kristian's post goes into much more detail and provides several examples.

With that explained, you may also wonder whether there are tools out there that make this process less tedious. No matter what, we have to manually tweak trap setups in-game and refresh mouse pages to glean information from their 'Difficulty' ratings. But, it would be helpful if we could at least specify a range of total trap powers, and have a tool spit out setups that match. From what I can gather, HornTracker's [Trap Combinations](http://horntracker.com/trapsetups.php?minpower=6466&maxpower=7075&ptype=4&tabs=1) was the most popular tool for this purpose, along with tehhowch's GetPower sheet on [MH Reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B38esHSXteUJZTRhMDNjMzItMmU4My00YWU0LThiODctMDk0OWRjOGFkMDE4/view?hl=en). Unfortunately, both tools have not been updated in some time. As such, they don't include the latest items or effects.

This is where I hope 'Trap Setup Powers' comes in. With this new tool, you can: [1] hone in on one power type at a time, or include all 10 at once (be aware that a large number of power types ticked with a narrow power range will slow down processing by a significant amount), [2] specify a variety of power-altering parameters, and [3] choose whether to use owned or all items. In order to take advantage of showing only items you own, run the 'Best Setup: Load Items' bookmarklet before returning to the Powers tool.

#### &sect; Worksheet

This supplementary tool provides a mostly automated way to derive many mouse power values at once. Using the 'Powers' a.k.a. 'Powers: Worksheet' bookmarklet on [mousehuntgame.com](https://www.mousehuntgame.com/), select a mouse group/subgroup to target with your current trap setup and Rift Set tier. Then, hit 'Go' and a new tab will open with 3 tables: [1] Mouse Powers - displays sortable columns for mouse group/subgroup/name, and all 10 power type effectiveness values along with their respective min/max boundaries (calculated using your total trap power and mouse difficulty ratings), [2] Mouse Details - displays mouse group/subgroup/name as well as gold/points and links to specific Adversaries pages, and [3] Trap History - displays a reverse chronological history of the power types and precise/displayed powers captured from the bookmarklet.

There are several options to refine the 'Mouse Powers' table view. You can tick the checkboxes for the power types you'd like to be shown, select the mouse group/subgroup/name you'd like to filter down to, and then click 'Reload Table' to apply your preferences. 'Save Preferences' stores your settings in localStorage for future sessions. 'Reset Data' clears all worksheet data. It may be prudent to reset data if performance starts to take a noticeable hit, or if some unexpected data corruption occurs.

The recommended way to use this tool is to focus on a couple groups of mice and narrow down each mouse's min/max power ranges using a variety of setups generated by the main Powers tool. Once you're satisfied, copy/paste the entire 'Mouse Powers' table into Google Sheets (it should copy over very cleanly!) for further manual refinement, allowing you to reset the worksheet data.

### :bookmark_tabs: [CRE Tabs](https://tsitu.github.io/MH-Tools/tabs.html)

> Provides a convenient way to spin up multiple independent instances of the CRE tool. Each instance is located in its own `<iframe>` and setups are easily copy-pasted between tabs. Great for quickly comparing setups that are mostly identical.

|     Keyboard Shortcut     |                   Description                   |
| :-----------------------: | :---------------------------------------------: |
|    <kbd>Alt + C</kbd>     |            Copy setup in current tab            |
|    <kbd>Alt + V</kbd>     |           Paste setup to current tab            |
| <kbd>←</kbd> <kbd>→</kbd> | Navigate between tabs (when one is highlighted) |

## Developers

### :construction_worker: Build and Run

1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for your operating system

1. Run `npm install` to download project dependencies

1. Build required wisdom/population JSON and minified JS files locally using `npm run build`

1. Serve the tools for local testing using `npm run serve`, which spins up an instance of [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) on port 8000

### :clipboard: Populations

To update population data, download a copy of Jack's most recent database dump from [Keybase](https://keybase.pub/devjacksmith/mh_backups/nightly/) (refresh the page if it says 'Not found'). Then, import the data into your SQL client of choice (takes around an hour on MySQL Workbench 8.0 with MySQL Server 5.7.24 on Windows 10). Finally, use commands such as `npm run pop:queso` (full list in [package.json](https://github.com/tsitu/MH-Tools/blob/master/package.json)) to write updated populations to CSV files in `data/pop-csv`, or use `npm run pop` to fetch them all simultaneously.

If you would like to merge new data into the master branch, feel free to open a pull request - Travis CI will build it automatically and run the `build/process-sample-size.js` script, which generates sample size score deltas ([example](https://travis-ci.com/tsitu/MH-Tools/builds/91738912#L528)). We use this to verify that data is trending towards improvement.

### :barber: Coding Style

We use ESLint ([`config-airbnb-base`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base)) configured with Prettier ([`prettier/recommended`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/eslint.html#why-not-both)) to enforce consistent coding conventions.

_This is still a work in progress, along with converting the codebase to align with modern ES2015+ best practices._
